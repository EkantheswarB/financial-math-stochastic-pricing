# Financial Mathematics â€“ Stochastic Pricing Research

This repository explores the computational side of Financial Mathematics using derivative pricing models, starting with the Black-Scholes framework and extending toward stochastic volatility (Heston).

## Objectives
- Implement Black-Scholes model in Python
- Retrieve and analyze real SPX option market data
- Compare theoretical vs market prices
- Begin research paper for PhD submission (Dec 2024)
