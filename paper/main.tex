\begin{abstract}
The intersection of financial markets and mathematical modeling has long fascinated both practitioners and academics. 
While algorithmic trading first sparked my interest in finance, it was the underlying question of how risk and price evolve 
that drew me toward stochastic calculus and derivative pricing. This study presents a computational approach to pricing European options 
using the Black-Scholes model, and compares theoretical values with real SPX market data.

\section{Introduction}
My initial interest in financial markets began through trading, where market behavior seemed both systematic and unpredictable. 
What began as an exploration of trading strategies evolved into a deeper curiosity about the mathematics governing price movements, 
volatility, and risk. I soon realized that true insight lies not in execution alone, but in the stochastic models that shape financial dynamics.

The objective of this work is to bridge theoretical finance with computational implementation. By applying the Black-Scholes model 
to real SPX option data, this paper aims to evaluate accuracy, limitations, and potential extensions toward stochastic volatility models such as Heston.
